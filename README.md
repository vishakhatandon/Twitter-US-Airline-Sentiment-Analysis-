# Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis-
In this project, we will analyze the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) which contains 14,640 tweets posted in February 2015. These tweets are the passenger comments after their flight with different airline companies. This dataset is slightly reformatted and already contains a sentiment analysis which divides the comments into positive, neutral, and negative.
